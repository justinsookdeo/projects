# Next Project
## Project 2 : Create a Class Library

- Recreate this entire project (with the implemented changes) into a new C# Class Library. Name the new project 'WatertankVolumeCalculator'
- Do not copy and paste code, re-write the entire project from scratch and try to understand how it works
- Write one class at a time and fully understand its operation before writing the next class
- In your solution, create a new MSTest Test Project
- Write tests to test the VolumeService
- Create a new repo in Github and upload your new Solution (with Libary and Test projects)
- Pack your Class Library into a Nuget Package. Identity the version, author, description, etc of the Nuget Package.
